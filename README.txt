Game of Life


    This is the game of life by the brilliant John Horton Conway. Its written for the web and a running example can be found at www.conwaysgol.com. Its written in mainly javascript with a bit of php doing the job of generating the table and cells and form handling. Javascript handles the game logic and helper functions for the game.
